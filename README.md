Python Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ¯

Overview

The Python Number Guessing Game is a simple yet fun command-line game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game provides instant feedback on each guess, guiding the player towards the correct answer. This project is an excellent way to practice Python programming fundamentals, including loops, conditional statements, and user input handling.

Features

âœ… Random number generation (1-100)âœ… User input validation (ensures a valid number is entered)âœ… Range validation (rejects numbers outside the given range)âœ… Interactive feedback for each guessâœ… Tracks the number of attempts until the correct guess is made

How to Play

Run the script in Python.

Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted.

Receive feedback based on your guess:

"Too High! Try again" if your guess is higher than the target number.

"CORRECT!" when you successfully guess the right number.

The game will display the total number of attempts you made before winning.
